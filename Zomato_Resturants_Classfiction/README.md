<br>  - With a population of over 15 million, Bangalore is the third largest city in India and 27th largest city in the world. Bangalore is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the country, with over 51% of the city’s population being migrants from other parts of India. <br>  
<br>- Bangalore is sometimes referred to as the “Silicon Valley of India”(or “IT capital of India”) because of its role as the nation’s leading information technology(IT) exporter.<br>
    <br> - Bangalore has a unique food culture. Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru, with various kind of cuisines.<br>
    <br> - Some might even say that Bangalore is the best place for foodies. The food industry is always at a rise in Bangalore, with 12,000 plus restaurants currently active in the city, the number is still increasing. The growing number of restaurants and dishes in Bangalore is what attracts me to inspect the data to get some insights, some interesting facts and figures.<br>
